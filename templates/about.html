		Hey Raptors! If you find it hard to talk to people in person and get advice on different classes you're taking, you may find good use of this site. AskLASA is designed to serve as LASA's own communication platform for advice. You can talk to people your grade or reach out to students older than you for help.<br><br>
		You're probably wondering, What is the point of having yet another forum? I can't really give you a convincing reason, but I will say that the LASA subreddit hasn't been touched for over 6 years. I guess this is like a replacement for that. Plus, it's made just for LASA! Instead of giving out your data to some big corporation, you're giving it to me! A very trusworthy individual! <br><br>
		Of course, having only a few people on this site is pretty lame, and won't really help. So I suggest you share this with anyone you know, and hopefully we can foster a respectful, collaborative environment!<br><br>
		What are you still doing here? Have fun out there!  -Jai
